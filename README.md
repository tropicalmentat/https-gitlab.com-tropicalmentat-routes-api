# Routes.ph API for consolidation of backend services

This is a basic Flask app that consolidates the main back-end services for the prototype app. Requests from the client front-end are routed to the API gateway/reverse-proxy to this API and return the requested resources (route payload and bike parking locations) as JSON. 

To be enhanced further as the app evolves.
